# Chetna

Chetna is a seven-day prototype for neighborhood-scale flood monitoring and early warnings. It combines rainfall forecasts, terrain and OpenStreetMap data, and simulated sensor readings to estimate flood risk, display it on a map, and support human-approved alerts and safe routing.

This repository is at the Day 1 setup stage. The project structure and Python environment are prepared; the ML model, routing, alert delivery, and sensor simulator are not implemented yet.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- Conda (recommended for the GIS dependencies)

## Set up the environment

From the repository root:

```powershell
conda create -n chetna python=3.10 -y
conda activate chetna
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If installation of GeoPandas or Rasterio fails on your platform, install those packages from conda-forge in the active environment, then install the remaining requirements with pip.

```

SQLite is available through Python's standard library, so it is not an additional dependency.

## Initial technology choices

Python, Open-Meteo, GeoPandas, Rasterio, OSMnx, Streamlit, and Folium. Day 1 should agree the pilot city, grid resolution and projected CRS, and shared data contract before adding pipelines or application behavior.

## Forecast Ingestion and Database Storage (Day 2 B1)

Chetna ingests Open-Meteo rainfall forecasts, aggregates +1h, +3h, and +6h cumulative horizons, caches raw responses as JSON (`data/cache/`), and stores structured forecast records in SQLite (`data/chetna.db`).

### Running automated tests
```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v
```

### Running the forecast ingestion example
```powershell
# Run with offline mock data (no internet required):
python tests/example_ingestion.py

# Optional: Run with live Open-Meteo API:
python tests/example_ingestion.py --live --lat 13.0827 --lon 80.2707
```

### Programmatic usage for pipeline integration
```python
from src.ingestion import fetch_and_store_forecast
from src.db import get_latest_forecast

# Fetches 6-hour forecast, caches JSON, and persists to SQLite:
forecast_result, row_id = fetch_and_store_forecast(latitude=13.0827, longitude=80.2707)

# Retrieve latest stored forecast record:
latest = get_latest_forecast()
print(latest)
# Output: {'id': 1, 'timestamp': '...', 'rain_1h': 4.5, 'rain_3h': 24.7, 'rain_6h': 78.4, 'created_at': '...'}
```
